# DiscordOldUi
CSS Theme to restore discords look back to what it was before the visual refresh.

I slapped this together mostly using snippets from the official Vencord discord server. Big thanks to everyone there.
Please feel free to share further changes as there are still things that need to be reverted and I'm not an expert at CSS.

## Usage
- Download the CSS file
- Open Vencord/Vesktop (haven't tried BetterDiscord) and go to themes
- Select open themes folder
- Place the downloaded CSS file into that theme folder
